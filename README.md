# look6

Analysis folder contains all scripts necessary for analysis
Experiment folder runs experiment
Helper functions folder contains all side scripts that are used for analysis and experiment

Lets focus on analysis folder first. 
All codes are run by using analysis_vXX file (XX is a number that denotes file version). If you run this code, all analysis should be performed.
For analysis folder to work, 2 codes have to be modified:
1: look6_path_definitions. This contains path definitions to data and output. Here you must specify path where data is stored. As example, lets look at section "DJ office". In this computer, experiment "look6" is stored
